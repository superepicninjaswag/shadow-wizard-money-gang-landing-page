They reach the supposed location of The Black Spider at 8pm
Walking into the room carefully, Konto dodges a set of webs coming for him
The Black Spider begins to monologue to the group as they make their way into the room
She even tells the party about Glass Staffs cowardice
Explaining that she plans to use the Foundry to take over Lolth as a Goddess
A tedious fight breaks out after Rib advances on The Black Spider
Rib, Konto and Vormer shred spiders left and right
Droop, however, is left outside the room, trapped by a spider in front of her
The Black Spider is enraged by the groups inncessent tirade and transforms
Her body falls to the floor, 8 legs split her back as she grows a Thorax and begins to spit acid at our heroes
Konto goes down in the acid, protecting his comrades with his shield
Rib cleaves into The Black Spider while Vormer takes on spider after spider trying to pick up his friend
Another ball of acid slams into the whole group and Konto begins finding it difficult to see
His vision blurs as the last thing he sees is The Black Spiders torso being ripped from her legs by Rib
A smile set upon his face as bricks begin to fall around him, light gleames and a womans voice tells him
"Your life has not been wasted, smile for you have made a difference in your time here"
Vormer turns to see Konto, lifeless
Rib and Vormer set about looting the dead
Droop, finally let into the room as the last spider is slain
Using a key they find on The Black Spider, the group open a locked room to find Gundren Rockseeker and his brother

Rib carves away with Archbane
Vormer throws fists

Blinded, Venomfang fails to hit any of the party then takes to the sky the next chance he gets
Determined to take him down Vormer downs a potion of flying, taking to the skies
He begins to run on the air after running out of flying speed
With a stunning strike to the Gut, Venomfang falls out of the sky
Rib pours a vial of acid on Venomfangs right eye

Now proned, Blinded, Incapped, and without an eye, The team beats the shit out of him
Only when Rib strikes Venomfang from behind does the trauma of the defeat destroy Venomfang completely

With Venomfang dead, our heroes (Minus Rib) head back to Neverwiter

On the 22nd session, their 30th day of their adventure at 9pm; Our heroes (Minus Droop) meet the King of Neverwinter
At the Royal Palace, Rib, Konto, Vormer, and Olivia are deemed "Dragon Slayers" their names are taken down so that they may be called upon again should the need arise
As the King lays his sword upon their shoulders, Rolen meets them with their new Venomfang gear
Rib, Dragon Slayer receives Dragon Scale Gauntlets
Vormer, Dragon Slayer receives Dragon Scale Gauntlets
Konto, Dragon Slayer receives Dragon Scale Mail

From here, the King leaves to allow the party to mingle with the High Society that now surround our adventurers
They meet a Tailor who would love nothing more than to style the heroes
They meet the head of a Temple who would love to train them
They meet an armourer who supplies only the greatest of arms
Then, individually they all meet a Human, Black hair, Blue eyes, Glasses, Blue Blazer, White shirt, brown vest, black shoes, black pants
The man meets Konto first, he asks for an autograph of the Tiefling, surprised that a Human of high society would speak to him, let alone look at him, the man seems to dispel a Minor Illusion spell, revealing 2 red horns purtruding from his forehead
"People like us need to look our for one another, and I think its important work, what youre doing. I hope that maybe this can bring about some change in this city"
And with that, Konto signs his name in the book
The man introduces himself as Caspian Deathtome before leaving Konto to himself
Vormer is next to meet him, even more untrusting than Konto, Vormer signs his name in a way that isnt his name but looks as though it is
Caspian moves on to Rib who doesnt seem to give the man the time of day
As Caspain raves about how much of a fan he is, Rib signs the book but the two are interupted by a woman beginning to flirt with Rib
Caspian takes his leave

As the party settles, Konto leaves and takes a tour of Neverwinter and its various religious institutes
Vormer instead, stays the night at a luxurious Inn

A tome of names
The group are thanked by people of the town for clearing out the Redbrands
A week passes
Day 42
 
Rib and Droop have settled into the home Krakton, Galleon and Rib had built
Not quite used as a store so much as it is storage and board
Olivia comes to visit often, she says a prayer for her fallen older brother figure
Galleons Grave is wet with tears at least once a month, but every day it gets a little easier

The team spend one last night together drinking and partying into the earlier hours of the day
Light pierces the sky 
Phandalin slowly awakens as Rib, Konto, Vormer, Droop and Olivia sit on the hill gazing at the sunrise
Konto flips through the pages of the book they found
A number of names they don't recognize are signed, but there at the end of the book they see "Konto" "Rib" "Remov" and "Olivia Rymora"
and finally on the last page they see "Property of Caspian Deathtome, The Glass Staff"

Nothing comes of their investigations. The Glass Staff seemingly fell off the face of Faerun
with no significant progress,
Konto goes home, thanking his friends for the journey, he is always welcome in their Phandalin home
Vormer follows suite, he too departs onto his own adventure
Droop continues to live in Phandalin Fishing Home, every night curled up to the Sickle given to her by Krakton
Olivia goes home to Neverwinter, visting every now and then, she trains to become someone her brother would be proud of, she eventually pays off her party's debt for Konto's revival.
Galleon sleeps 6 feet under Phandalin dirt
Krakton continues to improve himself, perhaps retrieving the gifts sent to him by his Deity: all unknown to his once comrades
Rib continues to live a quiet life in Phandlin, everyday is spent almost killing Droop, writing to Olivia, wondering where Krakton had gone, and talking to his friends grave, Galleon.
